# Sentiment Analysis with Neural Network

📚🔍🎥

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using neural network models. The dataset used for this project is the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset, which consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. 🎬🍿

## Plan of Action

📋🔬🚀

1. Load the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset (50,000 reviews). 📥
2. Preprocess the dataset by removing special characters, numbers, and HTML tags from the user reviews. Convert the sentiment labels (positive and negative) to numbers (1 and 0, respectively). 🔧
3. Import GloVe Word Embedding to build an Embedding Dictionary and create an Embedding Matrix for our corpus. 🌐📖
4. Train different neural network models using deep learning in Keras, including a Simple Neural Net, CNN, and LSTM models. Analyze the model performance and results. 🧠💻📊
5. Perform predictions on real IMDb movie reviews. 🎥🔍🔮

## Setting the environment

🔧📂🔗

The project is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The necessary libraries and tools used in the project include:

- pandas: for data handling and manipulation.
- numpy: for numerical computations.
- re: for regular expressions and text preprocessing.
- nltk: for natural language processing tasks.
- keras: for building and training neural network models.
- matplotlib: for data visualization.

The project also requires the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset and the GloVe Word Embedding file.

📝 Note: Make sure to set up the necessary environment and install the required dependencies before running the code.
